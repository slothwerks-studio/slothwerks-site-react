# SlothWerks LLC
## Homepage using the React framework

### What is this project?

This is the living, public repo for the SlothWerks LLC website.  It started out as a ["placeholder" site](https://github.com/slothwerks-studio/slothwerks-placeholder-site) using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.  However, in order to take advantage of contemporary web technologies, we decided to upgrade to React.
