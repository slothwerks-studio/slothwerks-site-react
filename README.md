# SlothWerks LLC
## Homepage using the React framework

### What is this project?

This is the living, public repo for the SlothWerks LLC website.  It started out as a ["placeholder" site](https://github.com/slothwerks-studio/slothwerks-placeholder-site) using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.  However, in order to take advantage of contemporary web technologies, we decided to upgrade to React.

### How is development done locally?

The project is run on a local server, which live-renders the site at specific port.  We bootstrapped the initial build using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
